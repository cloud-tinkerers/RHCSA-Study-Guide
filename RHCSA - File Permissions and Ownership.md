## File Permissions and Ownership with Possible Exam Tasks

As per your request, I've expanded the **File Permissions and Ownership** section to include between five and ten of the top options for each command, along with at least five examples of usage. I've also added a "Possible Exam Tasks" subsection for each command, which includes tasks that may involve using one or more commands together to achieve a goal. The answers are provided after the questions in collapsible sections.

## 2. File Permissions and Ownership

### **2.1 `chmod` - Change File Mode Bits**

Changes the access permissions of files and directories.

- **Common Options and Modes:**
  - **Symbolic Modes:**
    - `u`: User (owner)
    - `g`: Group
    - `o`: Others
    - `a`: All (u, g, and o)
  - **Permissions:**
    - `r`: Read
    - `w`: Write
    - `x`: Execute
    - `s`: Set user or group ID on execution
    - `t`: Sticky bit
  - **Operations:**
    - `+`: Adds permission
    - `-`: Removes permission
    - `=`: Sets exact permission
  - **Numeric (Octal) Modes:**
    - Permissions represented as a three-digit octal number (e.g., `chmod 755 filename`)
  - **Recursive Option:**
    - `-R`: Change files and directories recursively
  - **Verbose Option:**
    - `-v`: Verbose output, show files as they are processed
  - **Silent Option:**
    - `-f`: Suppress error messages
  - **Reference Option:**
    - `--reference=RFILE`: Use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

- **Examples:**
  1. **Add execute permission for the user:**
     ```bash
     chmod u+x script.sh
     ```
  2. **Remove write permission for others:**
     ```bash
     chmod o-w file.txt
     ```
  3. **Set permissions to read and write for user, read for group and others:**
     ```bash
     chmod 644 document.doc
     ```
  4. **Make a file executable by everyone:**
     ```bash
     chmod a+x runme.sh
     ```
  5. **Set permissions to read, write, and execute for user; read and execute for group and others:**
     ```bash
     chmod 755 program
     ```
  6. **Recursively change permissions of a directory and its contents:**
     ```bash
     chmod -R 600 private_dir/
     ```
  7. **Set the setuid bit on an executable file:**
     ```bash
     chmod u+s /usr/bin/special_prog
     ```
  8. **Set permissions using symbolic mode to give the group the same permissions as the user:**
     ```bash
     chmod g=u file.txt
     ```
  9. **Remove all permissions for group and others:**
     ```bash
     chmod go= file.txt
     ```
  10. **Use a reference file to set permissions:**
      ```bash
      chmod --reference=ref_file.txt target_file.txt
      ```

#### **Possible Exam Tasks:**

1. **Task:** Set the permissions of `data.txt` so that the owner has read and write permissions, the group has read permissions, and others have no permissions.

2. **Task:** Recursively remove execute permissions for others on the directory `/var/www/html` and all its contents.

3. **Task:** Add execute permissions for the user and group on the file `deploy.sh`.

4. **Task:** Set the permissions of `script.sh` to be executable by everyone.

5. **Task:** Change the permissions of `secret.txt` so that no one except the owner can read or write to it.

6. **Task:** Set the setgid bit on the directory `/shared`.

### **Additional Concepts in File Permissions and Ownership**

#### **File Permission Numeric (Octal) Values**

- Each permission (read, write, execute) has an associated numeric value:
  - Read (`r`): 4
  - Write (`w`): 2
  - Execute (`x`): 1
- Permissions are summed for each user class (owner, group, others):
  - For example, `chmod 755` corresponds to:
    - Owner: 7 (read + write + execute = 4+2+1)
    - Group: 5 (read + execute = 4+0+1)
    - Others: 5 (read + execute = 4+0+1)

#### **Special Permissions**

- **Setuid (`u+s` or mode `4xxx`):** When set on an executable file, allows users to execute the file with the permissions of the file owner.
- **Setgid (`g+s` or mode `2xxx`):** When set on an executable file, allows users to execute the file with the permissions of the file group. When set on a directory, new files inherit the directory's group.
- **Sticky Bit (`o+t` or mode `1xxx`):** When set on a directory, allows only the owner of a file within that directory (or root) to delete or rename the file.

#### **Possible Exam Tasks:**

1. **Task:** Set the permissions of `/usr/local/bin/program` so that it runs with the permissions of its owner.

2. **Task:** Set the permissions of the directory `/shared` so that users can create files, but only the file owner can delete their own files.

3. **Task:** Change the permissions of `public_html` directory so that it and all its files and subdirectories are readable and executable by others, but only writable by the owner.

<details>
<summary><strong>Answers:</strong></summary>

1. **Answer:** Set the setuid bit:
   ```bash
   chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/program
   ```
2. **Answer:** Set the sticky bit:
   ```bash
   chmod o+t /shared
   ```
3. **Answer:** Recursively change permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 public_html
   ```

## Tips for File Permissions and Ownership:

- **Understanding Numeric vs. Symbolic Modes:** Be comfortable converting between numeric (octal) and symbolic permissions.
- **Recursive Changes:** Use `-R` with caution; double-check paths to avoid unintended permission changes.
- **Special Permissions:** Remember the implications of setuid, setgid, and sticky bits.
- **Ownership Changes:** Only the root user or file owner can change file permissions and ownership.
- **Practice Scenarios:** Create test files and directories to practice changing permissions and ownership.
