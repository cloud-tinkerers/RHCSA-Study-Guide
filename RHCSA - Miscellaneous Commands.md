## Miscellaneous Commands with Possible Exam Tasks

As requested, I've expanded the **Miscellaneous Commands** section to include between five and ten of the top options for each command, along with at least five examples of usage. I've also added a "Possible Exam Tasks" subsection for each command, which includes tasks that may involve using one or more commands together to achieve a specific goal, similar to what might be encountered on the RHCSA exam. The answers are provided after the questions in collapsible sections.
